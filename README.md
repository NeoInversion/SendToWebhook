# SendToWebhook
Discord webhook messaging utility

## About
This is a command line version of [DiscordWebhookMessager](https://github.com/NeoInversion/DiscordWebhookMessager) written in Rust.
DiscordWebhookMessager had a simple UI and did well, but lacked in features. Since I created it, I haven't been interested in working on it again.
When I decided to make an effort to learn Rust recently, I thought this would be a good kind of project for practice. I plan on giving
this version a UI and extra features eventually.

## Known Issues
Since April 20, 2021, there are two known issues:
- The application may freeze momentarily while closing
- There is no way to verify that a request succeeded through the GUI
