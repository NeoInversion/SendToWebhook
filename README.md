# SendToWebhook
Discord webhook messaging utility

## About
This is a version of [DiscordWebhookMessager](https://github.com/NeoInversion/DiscordWebhookMessager) written in Rust.
DiscordWebhookMessager had a simple UI and did well, but lacked in features. I plan on eventually adding much more
options to this version.

## Known Issues
Since April 20, 2021, there have been two known issues:
- The application may freeze momentarily while closing
- There is no way to verify that a request succeeded through the GUI
